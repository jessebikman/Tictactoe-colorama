This is a tic-tac-toe game written in Python 2.7, and requires 
the Colorama library. Colorama may be found 
here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama and also 
can be downloaded through pip by typing "sudo pip install colorama" into 
a terminal window, assuming you have pip installed.

This is a 2 player game. 

How to run: 
1. Open a terminal window
2. Move to the directory containing "game.py"
3. Run "python game.py" and if that doesn't work, try "python2.7 game.py"

**Update**
I just started implementing 2 player ultimate tic-tac-toe

How to run: 
1. Open a terminal window
2. Move to the directory containing "ultimate_game.py"
3. Run "python ultimate_game.py" and if that doesn't work, try "python2.7 ultimate_game.py"
